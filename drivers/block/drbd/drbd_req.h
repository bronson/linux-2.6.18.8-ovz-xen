/*
 * Objects of type drbd_request_t do only exist on a Primary node, and are
 * associated with IO requests originating from the block layer above us.
 *
 * There are quite a few things that may happen to a drbd request
 * during its lifetime.
 *
 *  It will be created.
 *  It will be marked with the intention to be
 *    submitted to local disk and/or
 *    send via the network.
 *
 *  It has to be placed on the transfer log and other housekeeping lists,
 *  In case we have a network connection.
 *    FIXME I believe that for consistency we should place even READ requests
 *    on these lists, so we can moan when we detect that the other node is
 *    writing to an area that we currently read from (when this happens, our
 *    users are broken).
 *
 *  It may be identified as a concurrent (write) request
 *    and be handled accordingly.
 *
 *  It may me handed over to the local disk subsystem.
 *  It may be completed by the local disk subsystem,
 *    either sucessfully or with io-error.
 *  In case it is a READ request, and it failed locally,
 *    it may be retried remotely.
 *
 *  It may be queued for sending.
 *  It may be handed over to the network stack,
 *    which may fail.
 *  It may be acknowledged by the "peer" according to the wire_protocol in use.
 *    this may be a negative ack.
 *  It may receive a faked ack when the network connection is lost and the
 *  transfer log is cleaned up.
 *  Sending may be canceled due to network connection loss.
 *  When it finally has outlived its time,
 *    corresponding dirty bits in the resync-bitmap may be cleared or set,
 *    it will be destroyed,
 *    and completion will be signalled to the originator,
 *      with or without "success".
 *
 * See also documentation/drbd-request-state-overview.dot
 *  (dot -Tps2 documentation/drbd-request-state-overview.dot | display -)
